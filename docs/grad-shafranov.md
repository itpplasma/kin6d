# Fixed-boundary Grad–Shafranov

- Scope: 2D axisymmetric forward equilibrium in physical `(R,Z)`, `R>0`.
  Circular, shaped and supplied polygonal boundaries use the same engine.
- SI; physical counter-clockwise `phi`; flux per radian `psi`;
  `B_R=-psi_Z/R`, `B_Z=psi_R/R`, `B_phi=F/R`.
- Equation: `Delta*psi = -mu0 R² pprime - FFprime`.
  P1 weak form uses `grad(psi)·grad(v)/R`, three-point triangle quadrature,
  FortFEM meshing/basis and FortNum preconditioned CG.
- `q_seed` sets the source strength in built-in circular models. Actual `q`
  is an output; constant-q inversion is unavailable.

## Run and compare

```sh
cmake --preset cpu
cmake --build --preset cpu --target grad_shafranov_demo test_grad_shafranov
build/grad_shafranov_demo --config examples/grad_shafranov_circle.in
ctest --preset cpu -R '^grad_shafranov_'
```

- Namelist `/grad_shafranov/`: `r0,a,kappa,delta,b0,q_seed,max_area`,
  `boundary_nodes,pressure_mode,mesh_file,boundary_file,profile_file`.
- `pressure_mode='zero_beta'`: `pprime=0`, `FFprime=-2*b0/q_seed`.
  `finite_beta`: `pprime=-2*b0/(q_seed*mu0*r0²)`, `FFprime=0`.
  Boundary `psi=0`; edge pressure zero; edge `F=r0*b0`.
- Boundary file: number of points, then `R Z` rows, no repeated closing point.
- Profile file: number of rows, then ascending `psi pprime FFprime p F`.
  Sources are piecewise linear with constant derivative endpoint extension.
- Supplied profiles define a **derivative-controlled reconstruction**:
  `p=p_edge+integral(pprime dpsi)` and
  `F=sign(F_edge)*sqrt(F_edge²+2*integral(FFprime dpsi))`.
  Integrate each segment exactly; reject nonpositive `F²` or zero edge branch.
  Received `p,F` columns remain reference data, never silently overwritten.
- Nonlinear profiles use Picard relaxation 0.3, maximum 1000 iterations;
  failure returns status 2.
  Successful discrete weak residual is at most `1e-8`.
- Mesh export: comment, node/triangle counts, `R Z psi boundary` node rows,
  then one-based triangle connectivity. Supplied-profile runs also export
  `mesh_file.profiles.dat` with the executed five-column law.
- `output/grad_shafranov.nc` retains literal/resolved configuration, source
  profiles, physical fields, units and provenance. Copy it per run before
  repeating; the default filename is reused.

## Evidence and limits

- [Derivation](../theory/derivations/grad-shafranov.md): signs, weak form,
  Solovev/logarithmic families, Gold–Hoyle cylinder and flux/safety-factor map.
- `gold_hoyle_demo --config cylinder.in` exports the independent straight
  cylinder to `output/gold_hoyle.nc`; namelist `/gold_hoyle/` accepts
  `r0,a,b0,q,samples`. Generated C0 kernel and physical force-balance,
  constant-q and flux-derivative oracles keep it separate from finite-R GS.
  Example configuration: `examples/gold_hoyle.in`.
- `test_grad_shafranov`: independent polynomial refinement; nonlinear
  `psi=R²` cancellation oracle; linear implicit tangent/adjoint pairing;
  local generated field JVP/VJP and analytical profile primitive.
- Optional pinned FortSym build registers `grad_shafranov_symbolic_identities`:
  eight exact identities, no numerical probes used as proof.
- `gen/gen_grad_shafranov.f90` generates source/field/Solovev primal, JVP and
  VJP leaves. Fixed-geometry constant-source linear equation responses are
  supported; nonlinear branch and boundary-shape derivatives are unavailable.
- Every export is a **candidate**. Polygonal boundary, P1 field jumps,
  discretization and profile-model errors need independent refinement.
  A small residual does not certify the continuous equilibrium.
- No free-boundary solver, 3D MHD, kinetic transport or perturbation model.
  Flux charts and GEQDSK conversion are downstream adapters, not GS inputs.
- Current ITER comparison inputs/results and disagreement classification live
  in the TC24 repository's `equilibrium/`; received profiles are not exact
  oracles. Do not use cross-code agreement alone as validation.
